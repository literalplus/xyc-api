/**
 * XYC Lanatus is a common API to access certain premium data of players. This includes a common,
 * unified currency called melons and also a common 'last rank' field. It aims to support concurrent
 * modification. Furthermore, built-in facilities to manage products and make purchases using melons
 * are provided.<p> The name originates from the Latin name for watermelons, which is {@code
 * Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus}.</p>
